        A match has 5 levels. You win only after completing all 5 levels.\n
        Each level has a 60-second timer. If time runs out, the game ends as a loss.\n
        You start each level with 8 attempts. Attempts reset when you enter the next level.\n
        Wrong letter guesses reduce attempts by 1. Correct guesses do not reduce attempts.\n
        Level points are based on the word length and are added to your total score.\n
        Hints are optional and limited per level. Easy gives 2 hints, Medium and Hard give 1 hint.\n
        Available hint types are Reveal Letter and Eliminate Letters.\n
        Using hints does not reduce points. Hints only consume your level hint credits.\n
        You can play with 3 categories: Countries, Languages, and Companies.\n
        Your completed game results are saved in History.
